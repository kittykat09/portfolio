<h3>HOW TO MAKE BRAZILIAN FLAN
</h3>

<p>Add the eggs, the milk and the sweetened condensed milk to a blender. Pulse a few times to combine everything, then set the custard aside.
Then, before we move to caramelizing the sugar, bring approximately 2.5-3 quarts of water to a boil for the hot water bath in a kettle, or medium pan.
</p>
<h4>HOW TO CARAMELIZE SUGAR FOR FLAN</h4>
<p>All you need to do is add the granulated sugar and water to a small saucepan over medium to high heat. Bring to a simmer, and let it simmer untouched until it turns a beautiful amber color.

It takes the sugar around 10 or so minutes to melt and turn light gold, then it just takes a few more moments for it to go from light gold to amber color.</p>
<p>When the caramelized sugar is an amber color (and not any darker—it’ll be bitter if it is!), immediately pour it into the bundt pan.</p>

<h5>PREPARING THE PAN FOR BRAZILIAN FLAN</h5>
	
<p>Swirl the caramel around the bottom of the pan, up the sides and up the center piece of the pan, too.</p>

<p>With the pan properly coated, gently place it in the roasting pan. Then, pour the custard into the caramel-coated bundt pan.

Lastly, pour the boiling water into the roasting pan until the water is about halfway up the sides of the bundt pan.</p>
<h>BAKING YOUR BRAZILIAN FLAN RECIPE</h>	
					<p>Place the roasting pan in the oven, and bake. This Brazilian Flan recipe will bake for an hour to about an hour and 15 minutes.</p>
<p>Remove from the oven and let the cooked flan sit in the water bath on the stovetop or countertop for another hour or so.</p>			
	<p>After that hour, loosen the Brazilian flan from the side of the pan by running a paring knife around the inside and outside rims.</p>
	<p>Once you’ve done this part, refrigerate it in the pan for at least 4 hours or preferably overnight. I recommend covering with plastic wrap so that your flan doesn’t soak up any flavors/smells that are floating around your fridge.</p>
	<h7>UNMOLD YOUR BRAZILIAN FLAN
</h7>
	<p>After your flan has refrigerated, you’re ready to unmold it.</p>

<p>Remove the flan from the fridge. Gently shake/wiggle the pan to make sure it’s already “loose”.

Place a serving plate large enough to fit the flan and all that delicious caramel sauce directly on top of the pan.

Take a deep breath, and flip the plate and pan together! When the pan is upside down, the plate can be placed on a countertop. Then, gently lift up and remove the pan.</p>
	<p>That’s it! You’re ready to serve and eat!</p>
